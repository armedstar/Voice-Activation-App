 *  \section Overview
 *
 *  The NMSP <b>DictationResult utility</b> is available with the NMAS Resource
 *  and Dictation Resource modules when the application uses dictation.
 *  After a dictation, the dictation recognition server returns bytes that
 *  represent the dictation results. The NMSP DictationResult utility
 *  presents the dictation results to the mobile device user
 *  and manages any changes to the dictation results that the user makes.
 *  <br/><br/>
 *  The DictationResultFactory parses the bytes and constructs a DictationResult
 *  object, which contains the result with the highest
 *  confidence score and alternative lower-score choices for each word or phrase.
 *  <br/><br/>
 *  Typically, an application displays the top sentences on
 *  the screen and lets the user select a sentence (nmsp_dr_Sentence).
 *  After a sentence is selected, the user can manipulate the result. The
 *  user can move the cursor, select words, and insert or delete
 *  characters. The application must be able to capture the following actions:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>
 *  When the user moves the cursor, the application determines the cursor
 *  position.</li>
 *  <li>The application gets alternative choices for the corresponding word
 *  (or phrase if the device supports selection of multiple characters
 *  in a text field) by invoking the function <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_getAlternatives()</code>.
 *  The application can display the alternatives in a drop-down list
 *  and let the user select. The application then captures the user's selection
 *  and updates <code>nmsp_dr_DictationResult</code> by calling the
 *  function <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_chooseAlternative()</code>.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *  If the user inserts or deletes a character, the application captures the
 *  cursor position and updates <code>nmsp_dr_DictationResult</code>
 *  by invoking the function <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_update()</code>.
 *  </li>
 *  </ul>
 *  After the functions that modify the contents of <code>nmsp_dr_DictationResult</code>
 *  are invoked, the function <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_getString()</code> should always be
 *  called to show a string representation of the currently selected sentence.
 *  <br /><br />
 *  The main purpose of updating <code>nmsp_dr_DictationResult</code> is to
 *  continue to generate suitable word alternatives even when the user modifies
 *  the dictation result.
 *  <br /><br /><br />
 *
 *  \section Example
 *  The diagram below shows an example <code>nmsp_dr_DictationResult</code> object
 *  and some standard operations that a user can perform on this object.
 *  <br /><br />
 *  <strong>Get top choice result</strong><br />
 *  You can get the top choice result phrase string by first calling the
 *  <code>nmsp_dr_dictation_result_getSentence()</code> function for index 0,
 *  which is the top choice, and then calling <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_getString()</code>.
 *  <br /><br />
 *  The application can display this phrase in a text field.
 *  In this example, the top choice dictation result is "This is a test." The
 *  digits below the text indicate the cursor positions. The cursor position is between
 *  characters, either at the beginning or at the end of the text. The cursor position
 *  must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the length of
 *  the text string buffer.
 *  <br /><br />
 *  \image html DictationResult1.jpg
 *  <br />
 *  The example top choice contains four words and a period: This - is - a - test - .
 *  The cursor is in front of the first character T, and its index is 0.
 *
 *  Sample code:<pre>
 *  \code
 *  for(int i=0;i< nmsp_dr_dictation_result_getSize(dictation_result) && i<3;i++)
 *         presentSentenceChoiceOnScreen(nmsp_dr_dictation_result_getSentence(dictation_result, i))
 *  nmsp_dr_Sentence* selectedSentence = getSelectedSentenceFromUI();
 *
 *  char* str = nmsp_dr_sentence_getString( selectedSentence );
 *
 *  displayStrOnTextField(str);
 *  \endcode
 *  </pre>
 *  <strong>Get alternatives</strong><br />
 *  You can get the list of alternative word-choices by invoking the function
 *  <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_getAlternatives()</code>.
 *  Some mobile platforms let users select multiple characters in a text
 *  field (for example, by using a stylus), whereas other platforms support only
 *  moving the cursor in the text field.</li><br /><br />
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>
 *  On devices that do not support selecting multiple characters,
 *  there is only one cursor index. In this case, both the <code>cursor_pos_begin</code>
 *  and the <code>cursor_pos_end</code> should be equal to the cursor index.
 *  In the example below, the cursor index is 2, and you can call the function
 *  <code>nmsp_dr_alternatives_getAlternative()</code> to get the
 *  alternative word list for the word "This":
 *  <br /><br />
 *  \image html DictationResult2.jpg
 *  Sample code:<pre>
 *  \code
 *  nmsp_dr_Alternatives* alternatives = nmsp_dr_sentence_getAlternatives(selectedSentence, 2, 2);
 *   textField.setSelection(nmsp_dr_alternatives_getBeginIndexSelection(alternatives),
 *         nmsp_dr_alternatives_getEndIndexSelection(alternatives));
 *   for(int i=0;i<nmsp_dr_alternatives_getSize(alternatives) && i<3;i++)
 *   {
 *         dropDownMenu.add(nmsp_dr_alternatives_getAlternative(alternatives,i));
 *   }
 *  \endcode
 *   </pre></li>
 *  <li>
 *  On devices that support selecting multiple characters, the
 *  <code>cursor_pos_begin</code> is the character index that is inside a given word,
 *  and <code>cursor_pos_end</code> is the character index of another given word.
 *  If the user selects the two words "This is," the selection is
 *  from index [0,4] to index [5,7].
 *  <br /><br />
 *  \image html DictationResult2-1.jpg
 *  <br />
 *  The invocation of the method <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_get Alternatives</code> is shown in this sample code:<pre>
 *  \code
 *  nmsp_dr_Alternatives* alternatives = nmsp_dr_sentence_getAlternatives(selectedSentence, 0, 7);
 *   textField.setSelection(nmsp_dr_alternatives_getBeginIndexSelection(alternatives),
 *         nmsp_dr_alternatives_getEndIndexSelection(alternatives));
 *   for(int i=0;i<nmsp_dr_alternatives_getSize(alternatives);i++) {
 *         dropDownMenu.add(nmsp_dr_alternatives_getAlternative(alternatives,i));
 *   }
 *  \endcode
 *  </pre>
 *  Note that selecting part of a word is equal to selecting the whole word. For
 *  example <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_getAlternatives(selectedSentence, 1, 6)</code>
 *  has the same effect as <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_getAlternatives(selectedSentence, 0, 7)</code>.
 *  <br /><br />
 *  \image html DictationResult2-2.jpg
 *  <br />
 *  </li></ul>
 *  <br />
 *  <strong>Replace a word</strong><br />
 *  When the drop-down list of alternative words is available, you can replace a
 *  word in the result with an alternative word from the drop-down list by
 *  calling the function <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_chooseAlternative()</code>.
 *  As shown below, "There's" is the second element in the list. If the user selects
 *  this alternative, the sentence will be updated to use "There's" instead of "This."
 *  After setting the alternative, get the updated sentence from
 *  the dictation result by calling <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_getString()</code>.
 *  <br /><br />
 *  \image html DictationResult3.jpg
 *  Sample code:<pre>
 *  \code
 *  nmsp_dr_Alternative* alter = (nmsp_dr_Alternative*)dropDownMenu.getSelectedObject();
 *
 *  nmsp_dr_sentence_chooseAlternative(selectedSentence, alter);  // choose the selected element from the drop down list
 *  char* str = nmsp_dr_sentence_getString( selectedSentence );  // get the updated dictation result
 *  displayStrOnTextField(str);
 *  \endcode
 *  </pre>
 *  The new dictation result string is:
 *  \image html DictationResult3-1.jpg
 *  <strong>Remove a word</strong>
 *  Now remove "is" from the phrase by removing the three characters: i, s, and space.
 *  Normally, start from the end:  move the cursor to position 10, then call
 *  the <code>nmsp_dr_sentence_update()</code> function. For each change made to the sentence,
 *  the dictation result stays up to date regarding the modifications.
 *  </br></br>
 *  Note that the application <em>must</em> get the new result phrase each time an update is made
 *  because the changes and indexes for the result phrase are updated in
 *  <code>nmsp_dr_DictationResult</code> and <code>nmsp_dr_Sentence</code>.
 *  \image html DictationResult4.jpg<br />
 *  Sample code:<pre>
 *  \code
 *  public void onKeyReleased()
 *  {
 *              char* newText = myTextField.getText();
 *              int curPos = myTextField.getCursorPosition();
 *              nmsp_dr_sentence_update(selectedSentence, newText, curPos);
 *              myTextField.setText(nmsp_dr_sentence_getString( selectedSentence ));
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *  </pre>
 *  Now the dictation result looks like this:
 *  \image html DictationResult4-1.jpg
 *  The updated dictation result becomes:
 *  \image html DictationResult4-2.jpg
 *  Each time a key is released, <code>nmsp_dr_Sentence</code> is updated. The final result is:
 *  \image html DictationResult4-3.jpg
 *
 *  The same process applies for insertion: each time a key is released,
 *  <code>nmsp_dr_Sentence</code> is updated. In this example, we want to
 *  insert the word "long" before the word "test."
 *  \image html DictationResult5.jpg>
 *  The dictation result now looks like this:
 *  \image html DictationResult5-1.jpg
 *  The dictation result next becomes:
 *  \image html DictationResult5-2.jpg
 *  The final result phrase is:
 *  \image html DictationResult5-3.jpg
 *
