/**

 * required to create any NMSP SDK resources.
 * To delete the nmsp_Manager, the function nmsp_manager_destroy() must be used.

 *                            does not have a NMSP Gateway running on it causes the

 *                            to connect to. Specifying an incorrect port number
 *                            causes the connection to fail.
