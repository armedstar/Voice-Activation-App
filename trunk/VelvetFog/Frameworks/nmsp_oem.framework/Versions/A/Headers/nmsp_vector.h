 *  \section Overview
 *
 *  The NMSP Vector API provides a variable-length vector data container and the 
 *  associated methods that allow the storage and retrieval of specific NMSP
 *  data objects. The NMSP Vector object grows incrementally as new items are 
 *  added. Items can be retrieved from their corresponding index. Items can be
 *  inserted into the end of the vector or at any specified index. Similarly, 
 *  items can be removed from any specified index. The indexing updates required
 *  after insertions and removals are done automatically.
