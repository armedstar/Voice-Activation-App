 *  commands or to send a voice stream over the network to the server for recogniton
 *  or other services requiring the straming of a recorded utterance.

 * \typedef nmsp_general_audiosink_addAudioBuf
 *
 * Defines a function pointer to an nmsp_general_audiosink_addAudioBuf function.
 * This function is expected to receive and handle audio buffers. Depending on
 * the context, the implementation of this function may be different. For example,
 * if the corresponding AudioSink is receiving TTS results, the implementation of
 * this function may collect and store the results to be played. If on the other hand
 * the corresponding AudioSink is used for recognition, the implementation of this function
 * would stream the buffers to the server.
 *
 * <b><em>Note: </em></b> For better performance, addAudioBuf() should be called multiple times 
 * with small buffers, not one time with a very big buffer. The addAudioBuf() function works 
 * when the audio buffer contains 200 to 500 milliseconds of audio. This amount of audio
 * best represents a different number of bytes depending on the codec you use. If you have to use
 * one big buffer, your application must ensure that the buffer size does not exceed the
 * server maximum buffer size. To change the default value of the server maximum buffer size,
 * edit the value assigned to the XmodeInitialBufferSize() parameter in the NMSPGW.cfg
 * configuration file on the NMSP Gateway host.

 * \param audioSink			Pointer to the audioSink struct.

 * \brief The nmsp_general_AudioSink structure.
 *
 * This structure constitutes the audio sink that can be used to handle
 * audio buffers to be sent, or audio buffers received.
 * The object that implements this structure must be properly initialized. 
 * It is crucial to define the nmsp_general_audiosink_addAudioBuf()
 * function and assign it to the function pointer of the AudioSink
 * before using the AudioSink.
